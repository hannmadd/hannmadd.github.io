      <p span class="subhead"> Everything about this candle is amazing. It smells so good. I can smell it throughout my house. I’ve had it burning for two days now and it is burning totally evenly. You really get a bang for your buck with this candle. The candles I usually get are half the size and triple the price. I didn’t think I could find anything comparable to the smell, but this smells so good. If you’re thinking twice about getting this candle, get it I promise you will love it.</p>

      <p>When this arrived I should have known something was rotten in Denmark when a box arrived and 1/3 of the outside was saturated in oil. I, stupidly, opened the box to see what all was inside. Wondering if it was just the one item or were others tainted. On the quest to discover what was going wrong, I picked up the package of bubble wrap that I didn’t notice was completely saturated in orange oil and pulled it out of the box. Luckily, I did this over my kitchen sink. As I unroll the candle from the bubble wrap, more oil emerged in a disgusting dripping display. Finally, I came upon a slippery, shiny mess of a candle that was supposed to be in a matte glass except the oil caused it to be a gloss finish. With my hands covered in orange, smelling and colored oil by self there was no option but to attempt to clean it so I thought the dish soap hoping to cut through the oil on the outside of the vessel. I think I might’ve washed it 50 or 60 times in order to get all of the oil off of the outside and off of my hands. I seem to be constantly contaminating it or else it we can contaminate my hands. <i><b>In the most obnoxious evening, I stood there for hours at my kitchen sink, attempting to save a candle I hate more than anything, and dread ever having to smell again.</i></b></p>

      <p> This candle smells more like butter than vanilla but i like that; it makes my place smell like Im baking a vanilla pound cake, instead of like just smelling like plain vanilla! It’s almost halfway gone, but in all fairness, I’ve been burning it for about 8 hours since I first lit it. Only downside, I’m craving vanilla butter cake like crazy now!</p>
